'''
Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures,
return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to 
wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature.If there is no future day 
for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

Examples -
Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]

Input: temperatures = [30,40,50,60]
Output: [1,1,1,0]

Input: temperatures = [30,60,90]
Output: [1,1,0]
